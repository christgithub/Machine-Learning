        <p>
            In his article, Schwab shares his views on a 4th technological revolution and how it will change and
            redefine our daily life at its core.
            Although this drastic change will disrupt and affect every industry worldwide it could potentially yield
            positive effects on businesses and our economy; However, he warns that it could also create polarised
            categories amongst the work force.

        <p>Correlation and regression are statistical techniques to study,  quantify and describe the relationship between
            variables. Correlation quantifies the strength and type of relationship whereas regression expresses the
            relationship between one dependent variable and one or more independent variables called predictors
            or target variables.

            Regression with Scikit-Learn</span></h3>
        <p>In statistics, linear regression is a model that estimates the linear relationship between a scalar response (dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (regressor or independent variable).
            Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm widely used for binary classification tasks, such as identifying whether an email is spam or not and diagnosing diseases by assessing the presence or absence of specific conditions based on patient test results.
