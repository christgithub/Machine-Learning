        <p><b>Collaborative discussion: </b>The Fourth Industrial Revolution: What it means, how to respond - Schwab (2016)</p>
        <p>
            In his article, Schwab shares his views on a 4th technological revolution and how it will change and
            redefine our daily life at its core.
            Although this drastic change will disrupt and affect every industry worldwide it could potentially yield
            positive effects on businesses and our economy; However, he warns that it could also create polarised
            categories amongst the work force.

        <p>Correlation and regression are statistical techniques to study,  quantify and describe the relationship between
            variables. Correlation quantifies the strength and type of relationship whereas regression expresses the
            relationship between one dependent variable and one or more independent variables called predictors
            or target variables.
