            In his article, Schwab shares his views on a 4th technological revolution and how it will change and redefine our daily life at its core.<br>
            Although this drastic change will disrupt and affect every industry worldwide it could potentially yield positive effects on businesses and our economy; However, he warns that it could also create polarised
            categories amongst the work force. Schwab also presses for governments to emphasise focusing on security and promoting transparency to enhance communication with the public.To summarise,
            Schwab predicts an unprecedented transformation on our society, which if we intend to manage successfully, will require all parties to be involved.<br><br>
            This underlying dependency to technology can be illustrated by the consequences resulting from disrupted IT operations in the retail industry.<br><br>
            Amazon Web Services is a leading online infrastructure provider which is used and relied upon by 2.38 million businesses worldwide and, it owns 50.1% of the cloud platform market.
            On the 7th of December 2021, Amazon experienced a major outage, suspending multiple services, causing unimaginable repercussions. It affected colleges causing the postponement of examinations,
            household appliances seized to function, and online deliveries were cancelled. The outage had a domino effect on all Amazon’s retailers as well as affecting major media players such as Disney,
            PlayStation Network, Slack, Netflix and Snapchat.<br><br>

            The scale of this disruption demonstrates how brittle our economy is, how tightly coupled it has become with digital technology and can no longer perform without it.<br>
            Because of interweaving technical intricacies and scale, attempting to prevent this sort of incident and expecting systems to run with absolute resiliency seems nearly impossible.
            Could we expect governments and lawmakers to enforce frameworks to emphasise private providers’ accountability in order to guarantee compensation for loss incurred by such events.<br><br>

            Gavin mentions the Knight Capital software bug and the catastrophic financial impact and loss that this technical negligence yielded.
            This was a result of human errors dating back to 2003 when an engineer at Knight Capital had left deprecated server code in their SMARS application service and nobody had noticed this oversight.
            During a refactor 2 years later, the tests for power peg were breaking, so they were deleted. Nobody was using the long-deprecated option, so there was no longer a need to check its correctness.
            In 2012 when a new feature flag needed to be added to SMARS and an engineer reused the deprecated flag where no test failed during deployment since the old test had been removed.<br><br>
            As a result, the argument for the exponential speed in which technology and machines are evolving highlights the question whether we can keep up with technological progress and if we can, what measures are we willing to take.<br><br>

            Ben shows the precariousness our society exposes itself to by relying exclusively on interconnected information systems. To convey and illustrate his argument, Ben has chosen the CrowdStrike incident which occurred in July 2024
            demonstrating the chaos which affected various sectors and industries and was caused by a failed security patch update, allowing attackers to infiltrate their target network. The first critical vulnerability is that
            the attackers exploited outdated or not appropriately secured servers (Naseer, 2024)<br><br>

            Data governance and security are determining paradigms to this underlying and ubiquitous digital layer which is allowing our society to function. Proactively addressing AI-based security issues is a key factor
            for an industrial environment with smart factories, autonomous systems, CPS, IoT, cloud computing, and big data (de Azambuja et al., 2023). Organising actors to proactively protect against those threats is exemplified
            by the importance and the scope of cyber warfare.<br><br>

            Ben raises concern in delegating cybersecurity tasks to AI and machine learning. A recent study revealed that organisations are increasing the pace of adoption of AI/ML in cybersecurity and overall, close
            to three-quarters of firms surveyed admitted that they were testing use cases for AI/ML for cybersecurity (Kinyua and Awuah, 2021).<br><br>

            In handing over key responsibilities such as decision making and deployment to machine learning algorithms, Ben also points at the risk of reducing human intellectual skills which is a recurrent concern associated
            with the rise of artificial intelligence. (Ahmad et al., 2023)<br><br>

            Many thanks for your responses, of which both are insightful. In reference to Schwab’s 2016 paper on the Fourth Industrial Revolution,
            we can take it as an outset to the discussion of the effects of modern day technology which is evolving at a rate that can be difficult to keep up with.<br><br>

            However, as we know, it is imperative that we maintain the momentum of this rapid
            growth and change in order to provide a supportive and safe environment for global
            business, technology and finance to flourish; a hybrid cloud architecture sounds like a very good compromise to supply security in both the private and public cloud but one guarantees absolute privacy and the other, easily accessible information.
            It is interesting to see in the Nguyen – Sondano table, that proper training is the top
            concern for mitigating cloud security risks, followed closely by the implementation of
            IPS.<br><br>

        <p>
            Clustering is an iterative method for grouping a collection of objects in such a manner that objects in the same cluster are more similar in some specific predefined characteristics to each other than to those in other clusters. Leveraging the K-means algorithm, we experimented with clustering by loading the Iris dataset in order to surface different groups of flowers based on characteristics such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. After setting our centroids, we invoke the K-means method ‘Fit’.
            We use the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters so that we can avoid overfitting.
            By employing the sum of square error (SSE) we measure the total squared distance between each data point and the centroid of the cluster it belongs to.

            Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)</span></h3>
        <p>An Artificial neural network consists of connected nodes called neurons, which model the neurons in the brain. The connections between neurons serve a function similar to the brain synaptic neural connections adjusting their strength (weight) depending on stimuli. We experimented with the gradient descent function or loss function of an ANN by adjusting the learning rate which is the stride in sort taken during the descent along the function. The cost function is crucial to the learning of a model and offers a metric to measure a model's performance by quantifying the difference between predictions and actual results. The lower the value, the better the model is learning to fit the data in an optimal way. At the lowest value of the cost function, the model has reached convergence.
            Applying the calculations of chained partial derivatives to measure and adjust the ANN learning performance was fascinating and I finally was able to apply calculus to a concrete use case.

            In “The Language Machines”, Matthew Hutson undertakes a critical analysis of Large Language Models technological advances and the potential societal and ethical risks associated with their use.<br>
            The author discusses the outstanding language fluency of an LLM but he describes the characteristics of its process as purely mathematical. It
            works by observing the statistical relationships  between the words and phrases it reads, but  doesn’t understand their meaning (A remarkable AI can write like humans — but with no understanding of what it’s saying. By Matthew Hutson, 2021).
            <br><br>

            The lack of reasoning or understanding labeled as “nonsensical answer” which he observed in the results yields by prompting such LLMs has raised concerns amongst the AI community describing the models as “stochastic parrots” (Bender et al., 2021).
            <br>
            This inequality is exemplified as an inherent bias named the “coded gaze” by Dr Buolamwini. As a student, she reported a facial recognition software failure while working on a university project.
            After researching the cause of the glitch, she deduced that companies had introduced bias in their models by training their neural networks with uniform data. As a result, the lack of diversity
            in the data rarely exposed the models to similar complexion and the software wasn’t able to detect her face. (Buolamwini, 2023)
            <br><br>
            The benefits in using artificial intelligence in healthcare has proven to be a logical course to take globally, particularly for the NHS. The UK Government is investing in the National AI Strategy, investing money into research for the sake of progress and cost effective budgeting. The introduction of a smart stethoscope has been used to identify patients with suspected heart disease, the results proved to be accurate in its detection of heart issues; the results are promising so far, giving a strong indication leaning favourably for GPs to use the stethoscope in order to spot disease well in advance, in turn not only saving time but money spent on referrals, thus improving diagnosis time for the patient as well. Artificial intelligence has not only shown its capabilities in diagnosing lung cancer earlier, (as opposed to using the Brock score), but it has shown that it can detect early signs of other conditions and disease.(Artificial intelligence: 10 promising interventions for healthcare, 2023)

            In his post, James highlights the opportunities and challenges posed by the use of LLMs and more specifically within the healthcare industry where their transformative impact suggests an over reliance of their capacity.<br><br>

            Large Language Models have proven to be beneficial in many areas of a
            rapidly growing revolution in a new era of machine learning. Matthew Hutson conveys a doubtful opinion in his article “The Language Machine”; there are the potential risk factors in LLMs used by businesses and organisations
            in relying on what is still an emerging technology, because it is easy to access information and scripts, reducing time and money spent on researching and composing the literature manually it is easy to get used to relying on it,
            when it can be less than perfect.<br><br>

            Once again, the associated risks and ethical risks of becoming reliant on AI chatbots such as ChatGPT are obvious when clinicians, although trained and more than capable, use GPT4 for accessing and writing medical research papers.
            This, in the healthcare system, although beneficial, can also have its drawbacks.<br><br>

            In the research paper “The Global Landscape of AI Ethics”, its findings reflect the
            concerns of many people who, although embrace the fifth revolution it reveals the five principal concerns in AI:- transparency, justice and fairness, non-maleficence,
            responsibility and privacy. The landscape is wide and with time and prudence, on our
            part, LLMs can work well with us as opposed to “for us”.<br><br>

            In these times of using AI, it is proving to be a powerful writing tool for
            organisations from businesses to healthcare, and proving to be a valuable instrument in research, writing papers, composing emails and completing administrative jobs whereby that time can be implemented for expanding on other factors in an efficient capacity.
            However, as with everything that is created for making life easier and cost effective it
            comes at a cost.<br><br>

            The creative industry is under threat of becoming the worst hit and as such, companies that are using AI for writing be it creative or content, images, and artwork, the author and the artist are unable to compete against the speed and efficiency of AI generated pieces. However, the generative tools of AI are at risk of running out of ideas that would usually be taken from real authors and artists because many in the creative sector are reducing their pieces as a negative response to an infringement of their work; in turn this would mean that businesses who have previously enjoyed the ease of accessing creative ideas, will run the risk of struggling without human artists. So, there is the ethical side to revolutionary progress, which if abused can cause problems in the near future when humans revolt against the use of their craft being snatched away. Of course, the concern for job displacement for human workers from the labour force to office work and the medical sector is very prevalent across the globe.

            However, AI is far from perfect, and Matthew Hutson encapsulates the current situation by simply stating that “What we have today is essentially a mouth without a brain”.<br><br>

            Working on classifying images with a convolutional neural network and measuring the performance of the CNN was probably the trickiest part of the module.
            Preparing the data in advance to optimise its use by the CNN was a step further than more basic EDA. Each step of the dataset optimisation was geared towards
            specific requirements of the CNN’s image feature detection process and the operations the layers need to perform before passing the data to the classifying layers.
            Choosing the correct numbers of different types of layers as well as attempting to parameterise (hyperparameters) the model was an iterative process which required logging
            each parameter (learning rate, epochs, activation function, patience and early stopping) and results of the validating and training scores.

            The use of LLMs in policing and surveillance activity has shown how predictive models can amplify the marginalisation of certain communities.
            The data selection process used to train these algorithms needs to be regulated and scrutinised so that we can avoid societal inequality(Jain, 2018).<br><br>

            Large Language Models in healthcare can pose a beneficial means in assisting doctors, thus saving time leading to prompt diagnoses and early intervention for patients.
            Transitioning to digital imaging in the medical industry has leveraged the use of CNNs for patterns recognition and classifying images.
            Exciting gains have also been made in predictive biomarker analysis. ML models have been used to identify predictive signatures from peripheral blood samples and tumour biopsy material,
            including analyses of whole-genome profiles(Hunter, Hindocha and Lee, 2022)<br><br>


            However we cannot ignore the “robotic responses” conveyed from LLMs based systems.
            Although the accuracy of CNNs in the medical field is progressing at an amazing rate helping with prognosis, diagnosis and assisting in tailoring patients treatment the necessary bond between patients and their doctor remains paramount.
            In diagnosing patients,  human doctors have a unique way of making behavioral observations and showing a sense of empathy with patients that no machine can.(Cordero, 2023)<br><br>

            Collaborative AI in an ideal world, would yield the dream team; LLMs can work on the time-consuming tedious tasks that we as humans prefer to pass on to others. We are able to work on projects that computers cannot and in
            turn productivity higher and conducive to the increase of work generated between humans and artificial intelligence.(Slack, no date)<br><br>

            Discussing the fourth industrial revolution and the use of large language models in various industries and its impact on our life was extremely interesting.
            Those discussions broaden my views and thinking about the impact of smart AI powered technologies. On one hand, it highlighted and confirmed real concerns regarding the unemployment
            rate linked to the use of AI assistant tools and data privacy. Digital forgery is also a major issue which will progress exponentially, raising legal battles with authors and artists fighting for their property copyrights.
            On the other hand, the progress in the medical field is definitely counterbalancing the argument, offering invaluable help to practitioners and hope to cure illnesses still incurable to this day.
            I am a huge believer in AI powered robotics and it is also a field I really look forward to exploring. As we progressed in the course, I discovered many passionate researchers and writers in the AI community.
            Both technical and ethical researchers in this field really opened my eyes about how we could greatly benefit from a super artificial intelligence but also what is at stake in pursuing the development of an AGI.
            To name a few, Yann Lecun, Demmis Hasabis, Cathy O’Neil, Joy Buolamwini, Geoffrey Hinton, Emely Bender, Meredith Broussard… Will shape the beginning of my journey exploring this fascinating field.
